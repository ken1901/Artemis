## Test Repository instructions

#### Project structure
Make sure that the package structure of your test classes is equivalent to the package structure of your base and solution repository.
Otherwise during the test run maven will not be able to find the imported classes in your test files.

#### Static Code Analysis
The pom.xml contains dependencies for the execution of static code analysis, if the option is active for this programming exercise.
